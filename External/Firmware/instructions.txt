Balance Board Firmware:

To create and upload the firmware for the balance board:

1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Install the Adafruit BNO08x library
3. Open the balance_board.ino file in the Arduino IDE
4. Verify and Upload the firmware to the balance board sensor using the USB-C connection on the microcontroller (May need to remove the PCB from the case to access)

Body Tracker Firmware:

To create and upload the firmware for the body trackers:

EITHER:
1. Follow the SlimeVR docs (https://docs.slimevr.dev/firmware/) and use their online firmware flasher (WEMOSD1MINI, IMU_BNO085, IMU rotation 180, and enter WiFi credentials)
This method loses the external LED functionality, but is the most up to date

OR

1. Install the PlatformIO extension on VSCode (SlimeVR Docs should have a section for this too)
2. Open the SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP-0.3.2 folder as a project
3. Click the checkmark on the bottom toolbar of VSCode to build the firmware
4. Connect the tracker to the PC using the USB-C connection on the microcontroller (May need to remove the PCB from the case to access)
5. Click the arrow on the bottom toolbar to upload the firmware to the tracker
